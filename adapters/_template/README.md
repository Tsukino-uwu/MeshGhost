# Adapter template

**Frozen 2026-08-11**, at the end of Phase 5. The core was proven to run against a fake
adapter (`cmd/meshghost-fakeadapter`, a ghost that walks in a circle, driven by
`core.RunAdapter` — see [agent_docs/verified.md](../../agent_docs/verified.md)'s Phase 5 entry)
with no game attached and no import of anything under `adapters/`. This folder is what that
phase promised to leave behind: a reusable starting point for the next game's adapter, not code
to run as-is.

## What's here

- [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) — the three-function contract (`get_local_state` /
  `render_remote` / `despawn_remote`) and the tick model, written language-agnostically
  (pseudocode, wire envelope examples), because the next game (TEVI, Phase 6) is Unity/C#, not
  BizHawk Lua — a Lua-specific stub would not transfer. Every real adapter, in any language,
  implements this same shape by speaking the bridge wire protocol (`internal/bridge/bridge.go`);
  nothing here is Go-specific.
- The `core.Adapter` Go interface (`internal/core/core.go`) is a *different* thing: an
  in-process shortcut used only by `cmd/meshghost-fakeadapter` and Go tests
  (`internal/core/core_test.go`'s `TestRunAdapterInProcess`) to drive the core without a socket
  at all. A real adapter — including TEVI's — never implements it; it dials the bridge and
  speaks NDJSON, exactly like `adapters/pokemon/emerald/phase4_multiplayer.lua` does. See
  [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for why this distinction matters and where to look for a worked
  example of each.

## Folder convention

One folder per game, named after the game itself (`emerald`, `tevi`, `pseudoregalia`). Games
in the same franchise are grouped under a shared subfolder — `adapters/pokemon/emerald/`, and
a future `adapters/pokemon/platinum/` would go alongside it — purely for browsability as more
games get added; it's not a code-sharing boundary. A hypothetical Platinum adapter (NDS, a
different console/engine than Emerald's GBA) would share essentially no code with Emerald's,
same as any two unrelated games — grouping by franchise just keeps the top level of
`adapters/` from getting crowded by one series' many entries.

## Starting a new game's adapter

1. Read [agent_docs/contract.md](../../agent_docs/contract.md) in full — the packet schema,
   message types, adapter interface, and tick model are the parts that don't change per game.
2. Read [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) in this folder for the wire-level shape (connect,
   per-frame send/receive, redraw-every-frame) independent of any particular language.
3. For a worked, complete reference of a real adapter speaking this protocol end-to-end
   (connection retry, the hello handshake, NDJSON framing, the remote-ghost set, the tick
   loop), read `adapters/pokemon/emerald/meshghost_emerald.lua`. Its game-reading parts are
   Emerald-specific and won't transfer; its bridge-connection, hello, and tick-loop shape will.
4. Figure out, for the new game: what counts as `area_id` (a scene/level identifier), what
   `position` looks like (2D or 3D — the schema doesn't fix this), what `anim` tags are
   meaningful, and whether `get_local_state()` should ever return "don't send this frame" (a
   menu, loading screen, or similar).
5. Follow this project's verification standard ([CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)): no address,
   hook, or API call from memory — everything traceable to a source, and nothing in
   [agent_docs/verified.md](../../agent_docs/verified.md) until it's been watched happening on
   screen.
6. Do not modify `internal/core` or `internal/relay` for game-specific reasons. If something
   about the new game seems to require that, stop — it means either the contract needs a real,
   ADR'd revision (rare), or the adapter is trying to do something the boundary doesn't allow
   (much more likely).
7. When the adapter is actually ready to ship, add it to the release: give it its own step in
   `.github/workflows/release.yml`'s assemble job, under `games/<publisher>/<game>/` — nothing
   under `adapters/` is picked up automatically. See
   [packaging/README.md](../../packaging/README.md)'s "Adding a game to the release" for the
   pattern (and its TEVI section if the adapter needs a build step, not just a file copy,
   before it's shippable).

## Writing the new adapter's own README

Give the game's folder a `README.md` with a **"How this adapter was built"** numbered list — the
short, readable version of the story, one step per thing that happened, ~2-4 lines each, in plain
language. See `adapters/pseudoregalia/README.md` for the worked example. Keep the detail
(field names, dump sizes, failed attempts, dated evidence) in `agent_docs/phases/phaseN.md`,
`verified.md`, and `pitfalls.md`, and link to them — a step that has grown into paragraphs of
caveats belongs there with a one-line pointer left behind. See [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)'s
hard rule on this.

## Hard rules, restated (unchanged from [agent_docs/contract.md](../../agent_docs/contract.md))

- The adapter may hold a socket to its own local core process (the bridge) and nothing else —
  never a relay address, never the relay protocol, never bytes off-machine directly.
- `area_id` and `anim` are opaque outside the adapter that produced them — compare by equality
  only, never build a cross-game vocabulary.
- Coordinate systems (Y-up vs Z-up, tile vs world units, pixel origins) are normalized inside
  the adapter, never in the core.
