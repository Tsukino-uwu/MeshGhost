# Unverified — Pseudoregalia's queue waiting on the user

<!-- line-cap: none -- queue that drains; size is how much the user has not seen yet. Why: agent_docs/claude-md-cap.md. -->

**What this is.** [`VERIFIED.md`](VERIFIED.md) is the append-only record of what is *confirmed*.
This is its waiting room: things the agent believes work, has self-tested as far as it can, and
**the user has not seen yet**. It exists so work can continue while the user is away without
either losing track of what still needs checking or quietly drifting into calling it done.

**The rule it serves** (`../../agent_docs/testing.md`, `../../agent_docs/environment.md`): the agent
verifies the Go client/server with tools; **anything about a running game needs the user to watch
it**. A screenshot the agent took is not a substitute, and neither is a healthy log. *"nothing is
considered done/fixed until i actually confirm it as such."*

**How to use it.**

- The agent adds an item the moment it believes something works, with **what to look at** and
  **what correct looks like** — enough that the user can judge it without re-deriving anything.
- The user works down the list and answers each **confirm** or **decline**. Decline is a normal
  answer, not a failed handover.
- **On confirm:** move it to [`VERIFIED.md`](VERIFIED.md) with the date, and delete it here.
- **On decline:** it goes back to being work. Note what was actually seen — that is usually the
  most valuable line in the whole file.
- Nothing here is cited as established anywhere else while it sits here.

**Created 2026-08-27.** Pseudoregalia had no queue, and three files said that was fine because "an
adapter with nothing pending does not need an empty one" — while `../../agent_docs/status.md` was
carrying Pseudoregalia items nobody had watched. The premise was wrong, not the rule: the user's
call is that **every adapter carries this file**, and `preflight.ps1` now requires it. The entries
below were moved here from `status.md` rather than invented.

**This queue drains.** Confirmed items move to `VERIFIED.md` with the date and are deleted here;
declined ones go back to being work. An entry still here has not been confirmed. Sibling queues:
`../emulator/pokemon/crystal/UNVERIFIED.md`, `../emulator/pokemon/emerald/UNVERIFIED.md`,
`../tevi/UNVERIFIED.md`.

## Pending — the bridge port walk is built and has never been watched live

The 8-port walk (7778-7785) is in `MeshGhostPseudo/Mod/src/BridgeClient.hpp` — `BRIDGE_BASE_PORT`
and `BRIDGE_PORT_COUNT`, and `preflight.ps1` checks those constants agree with the two Pokémon
adapters. It is the shape the other adapters' walk was copied FROM, which is exactly why nobody has
watched this one: it was written first and confirmed second-hand.

**What to look at.** Two games at once, which is the case the walk exists for — one Pseudoregalia
and one other game, or two Pseudoregalia instances, with no bridge port set by hand anywhere. **What
correct looks like:** each adapter's log names a *different* port it settled on, and both see their
own peers. **What failure looks like:** two adapters on one core, which presents as peers appearing
in the wrong game, or one instance with no ghosts at all and a log line about a busy port.

Recorded as the built-but-unwatched half of "two different games at once" in
`../../agent_docs/status.md` and `../../agent_docs/ideas.md`.

## Pending — a hard crash mid-session after the pause menu opened twice (2026-08-17)

**Not root-caused, and not attributable to MeshGhost on the evidence available.** Seen once. It is
here rather than in `VERIFIED.md` because nothing about it is established: not the trigger, not the
cause, and not whether this adapter is involved at all.

**What to look at.** A session with the pause menu opened and closed repeatedly, with a peer
connected. **What would settle it:** the same crash with the mod's `constexpr bool` flags off — and
per `../../agent_docs/pitfalls/method.md`, a flag flip only counts as a revert if it gates the
*work* rather than the decision the work feeds, so check the flag actually disables the cost before
believing an A/B. Bisecting real commits is the method that cannot be fooled here.

Recorded 2026-08-17 in `VERIFIED.md` as an observation, not a finding.

## Pending — a `Fatal Error!` on game exit, seen once, never root-caused

Distinct from the 2026-08-16 level-transition crash, which is fixed and confirmed. Seen once on
exit; no repro, no cause, no attribution.

**What to look at.** Whether it recurs at all on a normal quit. **What correct looks like:** the
game closes with no dialog. **If it recurs**, the UE4SS log from that run is the first thing to
read, before any theory — a mod framework's own error log is the cheapest evidence available and
this project has twice gone looking for a rendering bug that was a load failure.

## Pending — every probe under the three UE4SS mod directories predates this queue

`PROBES.md` indexes them (three directories, six scripts). They are the record of how each fact was
established, and several were run before this file existed — so the honest statement is that nothing
in this queue depends on them, and none of their logs is evidence for anything not already in
`VERIFIED.md`.

Kept as an entry so that the *next* probe run has somewhere to land before it is confirmed.
