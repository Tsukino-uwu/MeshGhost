# Ideas — unscheduled feature backlog

This file is deliberately **not** `plans.md`. `plans.md` is the roadmap: what's committed,
in progress, or done. This file is the opposite — things worth doing someday, researched enough
to act on when picked, not committed to any phase. Nothing here is scheduled until it's moved
into `plans.md`.

Every entry states its tier on the depth ladder (`plans.md`'s "Depth beyond the cosmetic ghost"
section), what it needs, what it risks, and whether it's blocked. Two entries below (Emerald's
Union Room question, TEVI's ghost collision) got a first real investigation pass — see their
own sections.

---

## TEVI — cosmetic / presence (Tier 1, no memory writes)

1. **HUD minimap marker.** The natural sequel to the pause-menu `FullMap` peer marker (Phase
   6.7, shipped and live-verified). `MiniMapDisp` — the always-on HUD minimap, as opposed to the
   full-screen pause map — was investigated during 6.7 and explicitly not built
   (`agent_docs/phases/phase6.md:195-199`). Likely the highest feel-per-effort item on this
   list, since it's visible during normal play rather than only while the map is open.

2. **Bug: the FullMap marker is update-driven, not frame-driven.** `UpdateRemoteMapMarker`
   (`adapters/tevi/MeshGhostTevi/Plugin.cs:179-239`) only runs from inside `UpsertRemoteGhost`,
   which only fires when a `render_remote` arrives (`Plugin.cs:406`). If a peer's state stops
   arriving while the local player has the map open, the marker doesn't hide or refresh — it
   just sits wherever it was, stale, until the next `render_remote`. Real bug in shipped code,
   not a hypothetical.

3. **Nameplates.** Genuinely blocked, not just unbuilt. `Hello.DisplayName` reaches the relay
   (`internal/protocol/protocol.go:83`, sourced from `config.json`'s `"name"`) and is only
   *logged* there (`internal/relay/relay.go:295`, `:537`) — never redistributed. `Welcome.Roster`
   is `[]string` of ids (`protocol.go:107-110`); `Join` carries only `player_id` (+ optional,
   never-populated `State`). **No adapter can learn any peer's display name today.** Two routes:
   a roster/`join` shape revision to actually carry `display_name` (correct, needs an ADR per
   `contract.md:3-5`), or smuggling it through `extras` (cheap, but the wrong layer — `extras`
   is per-state free-form data, not identity). `internal/README.md:79` currently overstates this
   ("chosen `display_name`") — corrected as part of this pass, see below.

4. **Per-remote appearance.** Every ghost is a clone of the *local* player's own
   `spranim_prefer.pixel.gameObject` (`Plugin.cs:258-263, 265-321`) — there is only one
   template, the local character. Two peers on different characters/costumes both render as
   whatever the *viewer's* own character looks like. Needs a real per-character visual source,
   not just a config toggle.

5. **Ghost depth sorting.** Ghost z is hardcoded to `0` (`Plugin.cs:364`) with no sorting-layer
   handling against TEVI's own render layers — currently invisible only because it hasn't
   collided with a real layering bug yet.

6. **Config surface.** Exactly one `BepInEx.Configuration.ConfigFile.Bind` call exists in the
   whole adapter (`BridgePort`, `Plugin.cs:435-441`) — read once at `Awake`, no live re-read.
   Any future toggle (map marker on/off, ghost opacity, nameplates, verbose logging, the
   collision experiment below) needs this pattern established for real, not assumed. Do this
   with whichever toggle ships first, not speculatively ahead of time.

7. **Emotes / chat / area-entry pings.** Tier 1 per the depth ladder, and explicitly sanctioned
   as possible and write-free — but the right home is the **reserved `event` plane**
   (`contract.md:152-198`), not new `state` fields. `contract.md:163-165` states plainly that
   the state plane "does not grow new fields for deeper features," and it's lossy/latest-wins —
   a one-shot emote sent as `state` would either never arrive or repeat every tick until
   overwritten. Building the event plane for real is its own scoped piece of work: relay
   `to`-routing (already shaped for it per `contract.md:188-192`), a real `MaxEventBytes` limit
   (currently just a reserved line in `contract.md:373`), new bridge message types each
   direction, and the first real population of `Hello.Features`.

## TEVI — interaction ("test what's possible", scope stays visual-only)

8. **Opt-in ghost collision.** See "TEVI: ghost collision investigation" below.

## Emerald

9. **Union Room / spawn-based rendering instead of overlay drawing.** See "Emerald: Union Room
   decomp investigation" below — first real research pass done, with a clear recommendation.

10. **Seamless adjacent-map ghosts.** A ghost standing in a visually contiguous connected
    route/town simply isn't drawn — any different `area_id` is treated identically, seamless
    connection or not (`plans.md:167-174`). Would need real `pokeemerald` map-connection offset
    data (new, currently unverified addresses) and an extended screen-position formula near the
    boundary. Adapter-side only; doesn't touch the core's `area_id`-opaque rule.

    **Checked whether Archipelago's `worlds/pokemon_emerald/` data could shortcut this —
    real data, wrong shape.** `groups.py`'s `_LOCATION_GROUP_MAPS` (472 `MAP_*` constants across
    ~72 named groups, comprehensive — every route, town, dungeon) groups a place with its own
    *indoor* sub-locations (`Route 104` includes `MAP_ROUTE104_MR_BRINEYS_HOUSE`), not with its
    physically-*adjacent* outdoor neighbors — `Route 101`/`102`/`103` are each their own separate,
    single-map group. `extracted_data.json`'s per-map entries (checked directly) have encounter
    tables and a warp-table address, nothing about physical adjacency/connection offsets either.
    So this doesn't solve the seamless-route problem above — that still needs real `pokeemerald`
    connection-table data, unfound anywhere so far. **What it does answer, a genuinely different
    and more tractable question**: a same-*place* awareness check (a peer inside a building and
    one standing right outside it, on the same route) — worth as its own separate, much cheaper
    feature (a "friend is nearby" signal, closer to TEVI's map-marker idea than an in-world
    ghost) since it needs no new memory reads at all, just a Lua-side lookup from
    `mapGroup:mapNum` to the `MAP_*` name (derivable from the existing `pokeemerald` checkout)
    into this table. Not scheduled; would be its own idea, not a fix for #10 above.

11. **Bike / surf / ledge-jump poses.** Deferred since Phase 5.5 (`phases/phase5_5.md:32-42`).
    A ghost on a bike or surfing currently renders as an ordinary walking trainer — each has its
    own `graphicsId` in `sPlayerAvatarGfxIds`, unread today.

12. **Archipelago-patched-ROM facing fallback.** Designed but never built
    (`risks.md`, "Archipelago coexistence" entry): derive facing from the position delta between
    consecutive reads as the *only* code path (not a garbage-detection fallback triggered by
    "does this look wrong"), since `gPlayerAvatar`/`gObjectEvents` read as invalidated garbage
    under an `.apemerald` patch while `gSaveBlock1Ptr`-relative position reads stay correct.

13. **Nameplates via `gui.drawText`.** Same protocol blocker as TEVI's #3 above — this is a
    core/contract gap, not per-adapter, so it only needs solving once.

## Emerald: Union Room decomp investigation

**Status: investigated, decomp-only, no game/emulator needed. Recommendation: do not pursue
reusing Union Room's own code — the underlying primitives it's built from are usable, but only
via a MeshGhost-authored spawn path that still crosses the no-writes non-goal.**

Every claim below cites a specific file/line in the local `pokeemerald` decomp checkout
(`C:\dev\pokeemerald`, outside the MeshGhost repo — read with the user's explicit go-ahead,
per `CLAUDE.md`'s "ask before touching anything outside `C:\dev\MeshGhost`" rule, and per
`licensing.md`'s already-cleared "facts only, never code" posture for this project). No code
was copied; every fact here is independently re-describable without pokeemerald's own text.

### Q1 — What function spawns a linked player's avatar, and what does it write?

Two genuinely different mechanisms, not one — this is the single most important finding:

- **Group leaders** (up to 8, one per possible incoming link partner) are real `ObjectEvent`s.
  `CreateUnionRoomPlayerObjectEvent` (`src/union_room_player_avatar.c:174-177`) calls
  `TrySpawnObjectEvent(sUnionRoomLocalIds[leaderId], mapNum, mapGroup)` — a real, generic
  engine function (`src/event_object_movement.c:1530-1541`), not Union-Room-specific.
- **Group members** (up to 4 more per leader's group, `MAX_RFU_PLAYERS - 1`) are **not** object
  events at all — they're "Virtual Objects", created via `CreateVirtualObject`
  (`event_object_movement.c:1600-1643`). The engine's own comment at `:1595-1599` states this
  plainly: "a class of sprites used instead of a full object event. **Used when more objects
  are needed than the object event limit** (for Contest / Battle Dome audiences and group
  members in Union Room). ... do not have movement types or any of the other data normally
  associated with object events."

So even Union Room's own design had to split into two mechanisms specifically because of the
object event budget — a real constraint this investigation would inherit, see Q2.

### Q2 — How many slots exist, how are they allocated, and what reclaims them?

- `OBJECT_EVENTS_COUNT = 16` (`include/constants/global.h:46`) — the entire live `gObjectEvents`
  array, shared with **every other real NPC already on the current map**. Union Room's 8
  possible leaders alone would claim half of this budget if all spawned at once.
- `TrySpawnObjectEvent` → `InitObjectEventStateFromTemplate` (`event_object_movement.c:1287-`)
  first calls `GetAvailableObjectEventId` (`:1358-1377`), which linearly scans for a free slot
  and fails (returns `OBJECT_EVENTS_COUNT`) if none exists — **a full map silently refuses the
  spawn**, no error beyond a sentinel return value.
- Virtual objects draw from the separate `MAX_SPRITES = 64` sprite pool
  (`include/sprite.h:5`, `CreateSpriteAtEnd` at `event_object_movement.c:1614`) — a different,
  larger budget, but still shared with every other sprite the game itself needs that frame
  (battle UI, menus, field effects).
- Reclamation: `RemoveUnionRoomPlayerObjectEvent`/`DestroyUnionRoomPlayerObjects`
  (`union_room_player_avatar.c:179-182, 378-391`) and `DestroyUnionRoomPlayerSprites`
  (`:408-413`) are explicit, called from `union_room.c`'s own state machine
  (`grep` confirmed call sites at `union_room.c:2500-3034`) when the Union Room session itself
  starts/ends — there is no automatic garbage collection; something has to explicitly free a
  slot.

### Q3 — Does a spawned object get correct z-order/priority automatically?

**Partially confirmed, partially not established by this file.** `CreateVirtualObject` does
call `InitObjectPriorityByElevation`/`SetObjectSubpriorityByElevation`
(`event_object_movement.c:1638-1639`) — the same elevation-based sprite-priority mechanism
every real object event and the player's own sprite use, so correct occlusion against terrain
(behind tall grass, on a bridge, etc.) is genuinely automatic, for free, unlike the current
`gui.drawPixel` overlay which has no z-order concept at all.

**What this does *not* establish**: whether a real object event or virtual object renders
under the pause menu or a dialogue box — the original motivating question. That's a BG/window
priority question (how the menu's own background layer composites against the OBJ layer), a
separate mechanism this file doesn't touch. Not answered here; would need its own targeted
read of the menu/dialogue rendering code before claiming it as a win. Per `CLAUDE.md`, not
asserted from plausibility.

### Q4 — What happens to these avatars on a map transition, battle, or menu open?

Not exercised in this pass beyond confirming the lifecycle is explicit, not automatic (Q2). The
whole Union Room object system is driven by `union_room.c`'s own task state machine, itself
gated on being inside a Union Room activity — so "what happens on an ordinary map transition"
isn't a scenario Union Room's own code needs to handle, since a Union Room session has its own
enter/exit points. Genuinely unanswered; would need separate research if this direction is ever
pursued past today's negative-leaning recommendation (see Q5).

### Q5 — Is any of this reachable without real link/Union state? (the make-or-break question)

**No — confirmed, not just suspected.** Every entry point into `union_room_player_avatar.c`
takes a `struct RfuGameData *`/`struct WirelessLink_URoom *`/`struct RfuPlayerList *`
(`SpawnGroupLeaderAndMembers` at `:496-518`, `UpdateUnionRoomPlayerSprites` at `:528-540`,
`HandleUnionRoomPlayerRefresh` at `:547-551`) — all populated by the game's real RFU (wireless
adapter emulation) receive path, which requires an actual link/wireless session with another
real player. There is no code path in this file that fires from anything else. A single BizHawk
instance with no real link partner would never populate any of this data, so none of it can be
triggered by reading memory alone, and there's no "fake it locally" shortcut visible here.

**This is the real finding, and it changes the shape of the idea**: "reuse Union Room's own
spawning" is not viable — not because it's hard to test, but because the code itself only runs
inside a live RFU session. What *is* viable, in principle, is calling the same lower-level,
Union-Room-agnostic engine primitives directly (`TrySpawnObjectEvent` on a pre-existing map
template, or `CreateVirtualObject`) — which is a MeshGhost-authored spawn mechanism built from
general engine facilities, not "the Union Room feature." That's a meaningfully different, larger
piece of work than "turn on a feature that already exists."

### Q6 — What is the minimum write set for one ghost, and what's the blast radius?

Two sub-answers, because the two spawn mechanisms differ:

- **Via `TrySpawnObjectEvent`**: requires a **pre-existing `ObjectEventTemplate` on the target
  map** — confirmed at `GetObjectEventTemplateByLocalIdAndMap`
  (`event_object_movement.c:2430-2448`), which reads either
  `gSaveBlock1Ptr->objectEventTemplates` or the target map's own ROM header
  (`mapHeader->events->objectEvents`) and looks up by local id. **There is no way to spawn an
  object event whose local id doesn't already exist as a template for that specific map** — this
  mechanism cannot put a ghost on an arbitrary map without either patching every map's own
  template data (the brief's own "decomp ROM hack — cleanest, heaviest" tier,
  `brief.md`'s rendering-approach section) or bypassing the template lookup and writing a
  synthetic `gObjectEvents[]` entry directly.
- **Direct write, bypassing the template system**: `InitObjectEventStateFromTemplate`
  (`event_object_movement.c:1287-1312`, truncated read — more fields likely follow) shows the
  actual field list a from-scratch spawn needs: `active`, `triggerGroundEffectsOnMove`,
  `graphicsId`, `movementType`, `localId`, `mapNum`, `mapGroup`, and the three coordinate pairs
  (`initialCoords`/`currentCoords`/`previousCoords`). This is a modest, enumerable write set —
  comparable in size to what MeshGhost already *reads* today — not an unbounded unknown. That's
  a genuinely encouraging data point for feasibility, separate from whether it should be done.
- **Blast radius**: a slot-selection bug (writing to a live slot already used by a real map NPC)
  would corrupt that NPC's own state, not just the ghost's — `GetAvailableObjectEventId`'s own
  scan logic (`:1358-1377`) would need to be replicated correctly, including its "already
  spawned, do nothing" branch, to avoid this. Any write mistake here is a live-game state bug,
  not a save-file corruption in the strict sense (nothing here touches SRAM), but it's the same
  category of risk `plans.md`'s no-writes non-goal exists to avoid.

### Recommendation

**Do not build a Union-Room-based spawn adapter as currently conceived.** The specific feature
the user was curious about is unreachable outside a live link session (Q5) — that's a clean
negative result, not a dead end from lack of effort. The two underlying *primitives* it exposed
(`TrySpawnObjectEvent` against a pre-placed template, `CreateVirtualObject` for a
lighter-weight sprite with automatic elevation-based z-order) are real and could inform a
different, MeshGhost-authored "spawn a ghost object event" design later — but that is a new
piece of work, gated on the same no-writes-without-an-ADR non-goal every other write feature is
(`plans.md:29-34`), a real Archipelago-coexistence test first (since a write could race
Archipelago's own writes into the same object-event/sprite tables, unlike today's two-readers-
never-race posture), and — per Q3 — still an open question on whether it actually solves the
motivating menu/dialogue-occlusion problem at all. The overlay-drawing approach
(`meshghost_emerald.lua`) remains the right shipping default: it's read-only, it's the one that
demonstrably transfers to other BizHawk games and other Pokémon generations, and its known
gaps (base pause list, NPC dialogue — `verified.md:1028-1041`) are already accepted, documented
trade-offs rather than unknowns.

If this is ever picked back up, start by answering Q3 and Q4 properly (menu/dialogue BG-priority
research, and map-transition/battle behavior for a from-scratch write) before writing any Lua,
since either could independently kill the idea before a single write is attempted.

### Addendum — hijacking an already-live NPC instead of spawning one

A sharper variant of the same idea, raised after the write-up above: instead of spawning a new
object event (blocked without a per-map template, Q1/Q6) or synthesizing one from scratch
(the whole `InitObjectEventStateFromTemplate` field list, Q6), **re-skin an NPC the map has
already spawned** so it looks like and tracks a remote player.

This is meaningfully better-targeted than the from-scratch path:

- The game already implements exactly this operation as one function,
  `ObjectEventSetGraphicsId` (`event_object_movement.c:1820-1845`, by-local-id wrapper at
  `:1859-1865`) — re-skins a **live** object event's sprite shape/size/images/anims/palette in
  place, no respawn, no template lookup, none of the `OBJECT_EVENTS_COUNT=16` spawn-budget
  problem (it doesn't spawn anything new). There's a real precedent for this exact "make an NPC
  look like a specific player" pattern already shipping: `apprentice.c`'s Move Deleter
  minigame uses the 16 `VAR_OBJ_GFX_ID_0`..`_F` vars (one per object-event slot — not a
  coincidence) for live NPC reskinning.
- `MOVEMENT_TYPE_NONE` → the explicit empty callback `MovementType_None`
  (`event_object_movement.c:224`, confirmed as a no-op at `:2563`) means some map NPCs already
  have zero movement AI running. Picking one of those as the hijack target avoids the exact
  tug-of-war Pseudoregalia hit when its ghost and the game's own movement logic both tried to
  drive the same actor (`risks.md`'s auto-possession/drag entries) — nothing here would fight a
  position write every frame, unlike a normally-scripted NPC.

**What this doesn't remove**: `ObjectEventSetGraphicsId` is a *function call*, not a memory
write, and nothing in this project's Emerald work has ever called into the game's own code —
every existing capability is a pure external memory read via BizHawk Lua (no hooking, no code
injection; that's so far a Pseudoregalia/UE4SS-only technique). Getting the same effect would
mean either hand-replicating the function's writes (position/facing are already known-writable;
the palette calls it makes, `PatchObjectPalette`/`LoadSpecialObjectReflectionPalette`, do real
VRAM/palette-slot bookkeeping, not plain field writes — unexplored) or finding some other way to
trigger the real function, which has no precedent in this adapter.

**New risk this path specifically introduces, that the from-scratch path didn't have**:
hijacking a real NPC makes that NPC visibly vanish from its usual spot while a friend's ghost
stands there instead, and its dialogue script is presumably still attached to the same local
ID — interacting with "the ghost" could plausibly trigger the real NPC's own conversation. Not
investigated; would need checking before this path could be called viable even in principle.

**Net assessment**: better-targeted than raw synthesis, but doesn't clear the gate — still a
memory-writing feature needing its own ADR and the Archipelago-coexistence test
(`plans.md:29-34`), and now gated on one more open question: how far a hand-written replication
of `ObjectEventSetGraphicsId` can get without literally calling it.

## Emerald: VRAM/sprite injection investigation (draw vs. inject)

**Status: real staged test plan agreed, not started.** A separate idea from Union Room/spawning
above — found while researching a reference project (`GBA-PK-multiplayer`, CC BY-NC 4.0, see
`licensing.md`), which renders remote players by writing sprite pixel data directly into GBA
VRAM tile memory (`emu:write32` on mGBA at a fixed tile-bank address) rather than an overlay,
the middle tier `brief.md` itself names ("OAM injection — composites properly, much fiddlier")
and passed over in favor of today's overlay approach.

**Real risk found, not just theorized**: that reference project's own code comments show the
exact VRAM address needing manual re-tuning across just Ruby/Sapphire vs. FireRed/LeafGreen
("CHANGE AGAIN BACK TO 182 due to ruby/sapphire") — a fixed-address technique already proven
fragile across *vanilla* game versions, before any ROM patch is considered. Cross-referenced
against Archipelago's own `worlds/pokemon_emerald/docs/rom_changes_en.md`: the Union Room
receptionist's sprite was reworked, and the base patch is a full recompile — both plausible,
neither confirmed, collision points for a fixed VRAM assumption. See `risks.md`'s Archipelago
entry for the full citation trail, including the previously-undocumented finding that even
today's *shipping* draw-based sprite decode (`gObjectEventPic_Brendan*`/`May*`, fixed ROM
addresses) has never actually been checked against a patched ROM either.

**Staged test plan (agreed; Stage 1 script written 2026-08-14, not yet run)** — read-only
first, following this project's own "staged probe ladder must include sustained real traffic"
lesson (`pitfalls.md`, from the Pseudoregalia LuaSocket saga, where a light one-shot test
passed and a real corruption bug wasn't found until sustained traffic later):

1. Read-only probe of OBJ VRAM through normal vanilla play (walking, battle, menus) — is any
   of it actually free when we'd need it? **Correction, found while scoping the probe: there
   is no "the target VRAM region" to check here — no concrete VRAM/OAM/tile-bank address
   exists anywhere in this repo, only the opaque "182" quoted below from a project that isn't
   cloned locally.** Stage 1's real job is to *discover* a candidate free region empirically
   (cross-checked against the game's own sprite-tile allocator bookkeeping), not to verify a
   guessed one — see `adapters/pokemon/emerald/vram_probe.lua`.
2. Same probe, on a real `.apemerald`-patched ROM — does the patch touch whatever region Stage
   1 found?
3. First real write: one static test sprite, vanilla only, easily reversible.
4. Same write, patched ROM — the step that actually answers the Archipelago question with
   evidence instead of inference.
5. Repeat 3–4 under sustained real traffic (continuous position/anim updates), not a single
   static frame — a one-shot pass is not sufficient per the lesson above.

**Shipping shape, target state — decided 2026-08-14**: two separate scripts, not a mode flag in
one — the same "second script, clearly marked" pattern already scoped for the Union Room/spawn
idea above. **If injection clears every stage of the test plan and genuinely gives a better
result** (correct occlusion under menus/dialogue, the actual motivation for this whole
investigation), **it becomes the default**, with drawing kept as the fallback/compatibility
option — not the other way around. That's contingent, not decided in advance: the test plan
could also show injection is fine on vanilla but not safe under Archipelago (then it'd likely be
an opt-in for vanilla-only players rather than a blanket default), or that it's bad outright, in
which case it's dropped entirely rather than kept around as a permanent second option nobody
should use. **Today, before any stage of the test plan has run, drawing is simply the only
option that exists and works** — that's a fact about the current state, not a standing
preference for drawing over injection. Two real costs to plan for once both scripts exist,
regardless of which ends up default:

- **Sharing code between them is genuinely awkward in BizHawk, not just a style question.**
  Scripts load as in-memory string chunks, not files (`pitfalls.md`) — the existing script
  already needed an `io.popen("cd")` workaround just to find its own directory, since
  `debug.getinfo` can't. A `require`'d shared module would need the same workaround engineered
  around it. The more likely real answer is duplicating the read/send logic across both files,
  which means any future fix to that logic (e.g. the still-unbuilt Archipelago facing-fallback
  in `risks.md`) has to land in both, not one — a real ongoing maintenance cost, not a one-time
  fork.
- **Someone has to choose between them, and needs to know why.** v1: a documented manual choice
  at setup (packaging README states plainly which to use with Archipelago), not automatic
  detection — auto-detecting "is this an Archipelago ROM" would itself need a fixed-address
  check, exactly the kind of fragile assumption this whole investigation is about. Worth
  reconsidering only after the manual version has shipped and been used for a while.

## TEVI: ghost collision investigation

**Status: not yet started.** Scoped in the plan this backlog was written alongside — see the
"TEVI collision" deliverable there. Short version: user opted for an ADR-gated, default-off
BepInEx toggle, tested via a five-question live safety protocol on a backed-up save (can the
player damage the ghost, can the ghost damage the player, does the ghost actually block
movement, does it trigger hazards/room transitions, does it survive a zone transition) — not
implemented yet. TEVI's ghost clone carries no `CharacterBase` gameplay logic at all (unlike
Pseudoregalia's ghost, which *was* a second live instance of the player's own controllable
class and could kill the real player when attacked, `risks.md`'s ghost-collision entries) —
a reasoned expectation that TEVI is safer ground, explicitly not a safety claim until the
protocol above is actually run and watched.

## Pseudoregalia

1. **Reference project found: [pseudoregalia-multiplayer](https://github.com/highrow623/pseudoregalia-multiplayer)
   (`highrow623`), MIT-licensed** (confirmed live 2026-08-14, see `licensing.md`). Found via a
   YouTube video, not previously known to this project — appears to be another Pseudoregalia
   co-op/multiplayer mod, same problem space as Phase 7. **Not yet compared**: whether it's
   further along than this project's own Phase 7 work, uses a different approach (Lua vs. C++,
   which UE4SS hooks, ghost representation), or has already solved something this project is
   still working through (e.g. the falling-pose/ledge-hang animation gaps, or the not-yet-fixed
   exit-crash — see `status.md`'s Phase 7 entries). A real comparison pass (read its source for
   facts/approach only, per the license table's standing rule — never copy code) is a
   reasonable next step whenever Pseudoregalia work resumes, not scheduled yet.
