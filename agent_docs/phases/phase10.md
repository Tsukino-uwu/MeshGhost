# Phase 10 — the online stack: relay, client core, protocol, transports

**Status: open-ended, by design.** Created 2026-09-01 on the user's call: the Go side had no phase
file of its own, so its history lived scattered across ADRs, `scaling.md`, `hz-ceiling.md` and
`testing.md` with no single place to look back on how and when things were made. This file is that
place, **the same way Emerald got its "own" phase file (phase 8) after being built mixed into
phases 1-5.5** — the early phases interleaved server, client and Emerald because everything had to
be built at once and the project's shape was not yet settled (the user's own account, 2026-09-01).

**Scope: everything game-blind** — `relay`, `core`, `protocol`, `transport`, `bridge`, `netx`,
`cmd/`, `internal/` — one file for server AND client deliberately, not one each: nearly every
event here spans both (a relay queue exists because of client stalls; a protocol default is
inherited by both ends), so two files would write most entries twice or file them arbitrarily.
**Phase 11 onward is reserved for the fifth game and beyond.**

Unlike the adapter phases this is a **component log, not a bounded stretch of work** — it has no
"done". One dated entry per session or feature, appended in the same pass that closes the work
(`phases/README.md`'s keep-it-fed rule). Detail stays where it lives — an ADR per decision, the
measurements in `scaling.md`/`hz-ceiling.md`/`crowd-limits.md`, the runtime facts in
`agent_docs/verified.md` — this file is the timeline that says when and why, and points.

## Backfill — the stack's history up to the file's creation

Compressed from the ADR index (`architecture.md` — each ADR file's name carries its date) and the
commit log. Pre-2026-08-17 paths in the sources cited here are `internal/...`; see the module-move
note in `agent_docs/README.md`.

- **2026-08-08 → 08-11 — the shape.** Minimal game-agnostic adapter contract (ADR 0001), JSON as
  the Phase-0 wire format (0002), `area_id`/`anim` opaque (0003), Go core+relay as one codebase,
  two binaries (0004), relay unauthenticated through the early phases (0006), and an opaque event
  plane plus a `features` field reserved on day one so capability could be added without breaking
  deployed clients (0007). Built inside phases 3-5 (loopback → two players → the core extracted
  against a fake adapter, no game).
- **2026-08-12** — the core caps its own send rate to the relay (0009); the adapter declares
  `game_id` over the bridge rather than the config (0010).
- **2026-08-13** — a bridge disconnect closes the relay connection, so a closed game is a real
  `leave` (0011); `remoteStatesAt` filters remotes by `area_id` (0012). First real online session
  between two machines that evening (`agent_docs/verified.md`, the MYWANIP entry).
- **2026-08-14** — room-code auth and the peer `game_version` check, rejected at handshake
  (0013); relay lifecycle logging and permanent-vs-retryable rejects (0014); two full review
  passes across the layer (0015); the core auto-retries a dropped relay connection (0016).
- **2026-08-15** — the room's send rate becomes operator-configurable, slower-side-wins (0017);
  a relay can be restricted to a single game (0018).
- **2026-08-16 — the transport day.** `NDJSONConn` loses no message before switchover (0020);
  selectable tcp/udp/quic (0021) with discovery (`transports`, 0022), the
  handshake-is-always-tcp revision (0023) and the udp per-connection token (0024). An adapter
  may autostart its own local core (0025-0026).
- **2026-08-17 — the planes, and the module leaves `internal/`.** One adapter per core answered
  explicitly (0027); the event/lease/escrow/world planes past cosmetic (0028), capability scope
  (0029), rooms keyed by game+name (0030), world custody (0031); the packages move to the repo
  root and become importable (0032). The `event.v1` plane ships the same day.
- **2026-08-19** — TLS over tcp (self-signed, sniffing listener, optional pin); ghost collision
  becomes a host-set room policy resolved stricter-side-wins (0035).
- **2026-08-20** — an adapter may take area visibility away from the core (`render_all_areas`,
  0036); `internal/gameblind` makes the game-blindness rules mechanical tests.
- **2026-08-25** — `internal/cfg` extracted from the two mains' duplicated config plumbing.
- **2026-08-28 — the architecture week, in one day.** The first benchmark of the relay fan-out
  path (`e79f9e0`), then the fixes it earned: state lines built once via `AppendEnvelope`
  (`b5bd8f7`), the one allocation that scaled with room size (`b6eb327`); **a client stops
  restating an unchanged state** (ADR 0039, `IdleKeepalive` + the bracket sample, ~70% of states
  suppressed in real play); **the render model becomes three knobs chosen per game** —
  interp/curve/extrapolate+predict — and the snapshot buffer's count-bound bug is found and the
  sweep's three real bugs with it (ADR 0040, `fc4eb5c`); **the relay filters cross-area state
  for clients that ask** (`own_area_only`, ADR 0041, `b71fe22`) so the curve stops being
  quadratic; **every client gets its own outbound queue and writer** (ADR 0042, `955e2df`) so a
  stalled peer is its own problem. Nametags cross the stack the same day — `display_name`
  sanitized, `welcome.nametags`/`join.nametag`, `remote_name` over the bridge (`1246432`,
  `3698d4d`); the adapter-arrival declaration (`af32ed3`); the four-adapter bridge-port config
  (`15b2715`); a client that cannot dial a transport stops choosing it (`9089ddf`).
- **2026-08-29 — what CI's slower runner and the fuzzer knew.** The schedule fuzzer caught a
  change with no benefit (`43c4453`, `f4d525c`); a test was measuring the machine, not the ghost
  (`11e8173`); two more reconnect-deafness bugs (`4fa7ea7`); a reconnect cadence tests can
  compress (`f25b38c`, dated 08-28).
- **2026-08-30 — the Hz-ceiling program, and the orientation bracket.** The high-rate ceiling
  measured rather than derived and pinned as a test (`9d70eee`, `2b6abfd` — limits are
  per-LAYER, the cliff per-CLIENT); `maxSnapshots` stops being a functional bound (1024 as a
  pure memory cap, the time window rules — `c8aad58`); the results split out as `hz-ceiling.md`.
  **The core hands the adapter its orientation bracket** (ADR 0043, `1c960dd`), made an
  adapter-requested capability the same day (`b74a1d1`). The adaptive-Hz/1000-cap/JSON-vs-binary
  design work lands in `scaling.md`/`ideas.md`; the settings-defined-once plan in `plans.md`.
- **2026-09-01 — 15Hz, proven then inherited.** The send-rate floor watched rung by rung on
  Pseudoregalia, a blind 15-vs-20 A/B scored at chance, and interp measured per link tier
  (`956790c`); **`DefaultSendHz` drops 20 → 15 for every game**, the flood-cap derivation trap
  it sprang is pinned as a test, and the hang it shook loose was a real shutdown deadlock, fixed
  (`c16441f`). The relay stops dropping invalid states silently (`StateRejectReason`, throttled
  logging) after a silent drop hid a Pseudoregalia `extras` overflow.

- **2026-09-02 — loss cover, and the review's own regression found the same night.** Every state at 25Hz
  and slower carries the sample before it as a delta (ADR 0045, `abcbad1`), with `-loss-cover=false` as
  the A/B switch (`e5a6865`). Then TEVI's post-review run: ghosts snapping at every interp through
  `meshghost-netsim`, and the adversarial review's `netx.LimitListener` (`d91f8a8`, 01:28) turned out to
  embed `net.Conn` as an interface, hiding `WriteUnreliable` — every state the relay forwarded over quic
  or udp rode the reliable stream from 01:28 until `341a768` (21:45). Found with two new stats-line
  meters (`buffer dry`, `transit`) and a `QLOGDIR`-gated qlog tracer on `netx/quicconn`; regression test
  `TestLimitListenerKeepsTheUnreliableWrite`. Suite and `-race` green. `agent_docs/verified.md`, "The
  limiter hid WriteUnreliable".

## Open

What is open on this stack at any moment is `agent_docs/status.md`'s job, not this file's —
today's snapshot there includes the catmull-rom uneven-spacing defect, `internal/e2e`'s
`freePort` TOCTOU, and the two shipped settings that reach too few adapters.
