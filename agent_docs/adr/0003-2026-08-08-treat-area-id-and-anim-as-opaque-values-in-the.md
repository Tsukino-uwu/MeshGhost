# 2026-08-08 — Treat `area_id` and `anim` as opaque values in the core

<!-- ADR 0003. Indexed in ../architecture.md, which is the decision log front door. -->

- **Date:** 2026-08-08
- **Decision:** Treat `area_id` and `anim` as opaque values in the core.
- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** The core should avoid game-specific assumptions and keep the contract
  reusable.
- **Options considered:** normalized area identifiers, shared animation vocabulary,
  game-specific core branches.
- **Resolution:** Keep `area_id` and `anim` opaque and compare them only by equality in the
  core.
- **Consequences:** Adapters carry game-specific interpretation; the core stays simpler and
  more portable.
